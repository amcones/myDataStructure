# My Data Structure

[English](README.md)/[中文](doc/README_zh.md)

My data structures' implementation with golang.

## Featured

- generic functions
- reliable implementation
- fully annotated

## Contents

- FenwickTree
- Priority Queue
- Queue
- SegmentTree
- Sparse Table
- Stack
- and so on

## Why this

I found it difficult to find a package with these frequently-used data structures that implement the generic functions
in golang.

By the way, I want to improve my implementation ability in golang and improve my understanding of data structures.

So I do this.
